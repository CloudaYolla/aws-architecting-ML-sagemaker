# Using SageMaker AutoPilot to Solve the Banking Fraud Problem
Consider Using AutoPilot to Predict the Banking Fraud Use case



How does AutoPilot fit into the picture? Assume that you are hungry. You have 3 options. 
- First is to call your favorite restaurant and order food. This corresponds to the AI Services stack on AWS (e.g. using Textract service to do AI based OCR, or using Comprehend to do sentiment analysis).
- Second option is to go to kitchen, and cook your food using a favorite receipe from your grandma. That is what AutoPilot does for you.
- Third option is to go to kitchen and cook your own food using your own receipe. That is what we will see with Amazon SageMaker.
